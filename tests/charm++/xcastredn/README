This benchmark measures the performance of the communication mechanisms in the
charm software stack. The comm operations being measured are Xcasts and Reductions.


The mechanisms that are tested are:
1) Converse broadcast/reduction
2) Charm Array broadcast/reduction
3) CkMulticast Array section multicast/reduction


The test defaults to placing a single chare array member on each PE and then measuring
the average time taken for multiple xcast/redn loops using different mechanisms. Tests
are conducted for a range of message sizes. Output reported includes the average time,
max, min and std. deviation to put the results in a correct perspective.

These tests can be conducted as a pure benchmark or (to mimic real-world scenarios)
with the presence of other entry methods in the scheduler queue. Such entry methods
do not add any memory or network pressure. They are zombie methods that keep calling
themselves so that the scheduler queue remains filled to the desired length. The time
taken by each such 'fill' method to execute can also be controlled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make and make test should do the trick.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
- The program can be run with no args (uses a set of defaults)
- All the args are optional. If the section / array size are not specified, they default to the number of PEs.

The args must be specified in the following order:

- numRepeats          [int]  : The number of times to repeat the collective (xcast/redn) loop
- msgSizeMin          [int]  : The minimum message size in bytes
- msgSizeMax          [int]  : The maximum message size in KB
- qLength             [int]  : The length of the scheduler queue (num of pending entry methods)
- fillMethodDuration  [int]  : The time taken for each fill entry method to execute in us (microseconds)

- sectionDim          [int]
- isSectionContiguous [bool] : Should the array section be contiguous (0/1) [see below]
- arrayDim            [int]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

1) The minimum msg size is in *bytes* while the max message size is in *Kilobytes*.

2) isSectionContiguous can toggle the creation of sections where elements are
   picked at discrete intervals within the chare array. This makes sense only
   if the section size is appropriately smaller than the array size. For eg,
   if the array is 10 and the section size is 2 then indices of the elements in
   the section will be:

    contiguous section: 0, 1
    not contiguous sec: 0, 5
