	Virtual IDs were created so that a chare could be sent messages
to even before it's data block is actually set up. The was this is done
is by creating a virtual block for the chare, where all messages for it
are created, and when the actual data area of the chare is created it
requests for any messages that might have been sent before its creation.

	The procedure VidQueueUpInVidBlock looks at the	the address of
the virtual id block, available as part of the message, and determines 
whether or not the chare has been created. If the chare hasn't been
created, then msgPtr is queued up in the virtual block, else
the message is forwarded to the processor on which the chare
was created.						

	Once the chare ha been created it needs to get the messages
that were sent to it while it hadn't been created. The procedure
VidSendOverMessages does this.  These messages are queued
up in its virtual id block, whose address it has available. 
The chare on creation sends a messages to the branch office chare, 
on which the virtual block reside asking it to send over the messages 
to it. The messages are then dequeued and sent over to the processor
 on which the chare was finally created. 			
	The SysSendMsgBranch is replication of the SendMsgBranch call,
 but sends the message with the category field as VIDcat.
