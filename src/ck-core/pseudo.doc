	This directory contains the files for the pseudoglobal variables.
	All of them are implemented as branch office chares. 
	The initial values of these pseudoglobal variables are broadcast
alongwith the values of all variables created during the DataInit phase.
	The code for the branch office chares for the accumulators and
monotonic variables appear in the translator directory.
	For monotonic variables a copy of the variable is maintained 
on each node, and this local copy is updated. The updated value is 
propagated up a spanning tree on the nodes, and the updates are later
broadcast by the root to each node.
	For accumulators also a copy of the variable is maintained on 
each node, which is updated locally. When the final call for CollectValue
comes the local values are sent up a spanning tree and the interior
nodes combine the values that it receives from its children. The root 
sends the final value to the requested destination.
	Tables are also implemented as branch office chares. Each branch
maintains a fragment of the table. A hash function on the key returns
the processor returns the processor on which that key would be stored.
Insert, Delete and Find messages are then redirected to the correct
branch. Each branch has its packing and unpacking routines, which
collect messages from the other branches, unpack and decode the information
and perform the appropriate action, or else pack information to send
it some other branch.
	Writeonce variables are very well documented.
