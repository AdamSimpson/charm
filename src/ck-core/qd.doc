This directory contains the quiscence detection module, written as a system 
BOC.

Interface: It provides the entrypoint function/s that process messages
from spanning tree children, and boc functions (and macros, for
efficiency, in some cases) that inform this module that the queue is
non-empty, and wake up the module on the condition that the queue is
empty.
It also provides a QDinit entry point function.

It maintains the following variables/data structures.

1. Phase number: what is the current phase number. 1 or 2.
	initialized to 1 in QDinit

2. A "dirty" bit: reset on a phase 1 message from child.
	set by QS whenever a message is inserted in the queue.

3. A bit that contains the logical AND of children's responses
	in the second phase.
