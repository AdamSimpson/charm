	This directory includes the files for the main processes
on the host and the node. The host and the node processes are quite
similar. A description of the node process follows.

	The node process looks like :
		1. Call main_startup on node 0.
		2. Call node_startup on all nodes.
		3. Process all initialization messages.
	The procedure main_startup initializes all the queues, managers,
and executes the DataInit and the ChareInit sections of the user program.
After executing the DataInit section a broadcast containing initial 
values of all the pseudoglobal variables is carried out. This
is defined in the translated file.
	The procedure main_startup is executed only on node 0, but
the rest are executed on all nodes. So there is a slight asynchrony 
between the execution of node_startup on node 0 and the other nodes.
node_startup initializes all the branches, quiescence detection and
load balancing strategy. 
	In the third stage all the initialization messages are processed.
A count message is sent alongwith the initialization messages so that
the nodes know how many messages to wait for.
	The final stage is the procedure Loop defined in main. This is the
main loop that handles all the messages, other than quiescence (which are
executed as they come in). The messages are pumped from the queue using
NodePumpMsgs.
