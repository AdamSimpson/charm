	node_ck.c contains the basic Chare Kernel calls 
	The basic Chare Kernel calls include CreateChare, SendMsg,
CkExit, MyChareID, CkPrintf, CkScanf and many others. 
	CreateChare calls result in a message being created of type
NEW_CHARE. Its sent to the load balancer, unless the user requests
for it to be created on any specific processor, which (load balancer)
sends it out to the correct node.
	SendMsg also results in the creation of a message of type
FOR_CHARE_MSG, but since the destination of the message is fixed
by the addres of the chare to which it is destined no load balancing
is needed.
	CkExit results in the sending of a message to node 0, which
broadcasts to all other nodes to terminate. These nodes terminate
after sending back their statistical information to node 0. Node 0
terminates after receiving messages from all other nodes.
	For CkScanf the format is coded as a character string and sent
to the host process, which uses the character format and does
the actual scanf and then sends back the scanned input as a character
string to node 0. 
	All other calls are straightforward.
