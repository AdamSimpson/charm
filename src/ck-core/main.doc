	This directory includes the files for the main processes
on the host and the node. The host and the node processes are quite
similar. A description of the node process follows.

	The node process looks like :
		1. Call main_startup on node 0.
		2. Call node_startup on all nodes.
		3. Process all initialization messages.
		4. Enter loop to process messages.
	The final stage is the procedure Loop. This is the main loop
that handles all the messages, other than quiescence (which are executed
as they come in). The messages are pumped from the queue using NodePumpMsgs.

The procedure to pump messages into the system - NodePumpMsgs. NodePumpMsgs,
referred to as Pump hereafter, looks at the local queue, which includes
messages sent locally between chares, and the system by a probe function
- McProbe. If there are any quiescence messages it executes them directly,
all other messages are queued up in the appropriate queues and the
control is returned to the Loop in main.
