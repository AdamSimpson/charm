	The file node_boc.c contains the functions pertaining to 
branch office chares. Also included are some of the broadcast and
initialization functions.

	The following procedures appear in this file :
		1. NodeSysBocInit
		2. HostSysBocInit
		3. CreateBoc
		4. BroadcastCount
		5. BroadcastMsgBranch
		6. SendMsgBranch	

	NodeSysBocInit and HostSysBocInit are the functions that 
initialize the branches of the system branch office chares.
	CreateBoc is used to create the data areas for the branches of
 user branch office chares.
	Both the Broadcasts work similarly. The important point to
node is that the machines broadcast does not involve sending a message
to oneself; these messages are enqueued in the local queue, from
which messages are picked up by the NodePumpMsgs in ck.
