SENDMSGONCONDITION


NAME
	SendMsgOnCondition;


SYNOPSIS
	#include "condsend.h"
    #onclude "chare.h"


	void SendMsgOnCondition(cond_fn, ep, chareID, msgToSend)
	FUNCTION_PTR   cond_fn;
	EntryPointType ep;
	ChareIDType    chareID;
	void           *msgToSend;

DESCRIPTION
    SendMsgOnCondition allows the user to send a message to a chare when
    some condition becomes true. This is done by passing the function
    a pointer to a routine that can determine if the condition has become
    true. SendMsgOnCondtion also requires the normal information required 
	to send a message. Periodically, the system will call specified function 
	(with no parameters). If the function returns a non-zero value, then 
	the message will be sent to the specified chare, at the specified entry 
	point. Once this occurs, then the condition function will no longer be 
	called by the system.


EXAMPLES

SEE ALSO
	CallBocOnCondition()

RESTRICTIONS
	The condition function to be called must not take any parameters. Once
	the condition function returns true and the message is sent, it will
    not be called anymore.
