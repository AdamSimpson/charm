CALLBOCONCONDITION

NAME
	CallBocOnCondition

SYNOPSIS
	#include "condsend.h"
    #include "chare.h"


	void CallBocOnCondition(boc_fn_ptr, bocNum)
	FUNCTION_PTR boc_fn_ptr;
	int          boc_Num;

DESCRIPTION
    CallBocOnCondition allows the user to periodically call a boc access
    function, presumably to check for some condition and then to act
    accordingly. The user passes in a pointer to a boc access function
    as well as the correct boc number. The system then periodically 
    calls this function. If this function ever returns a non-zero value
    then the system assumes that whatever actions the user wished to
    accomplish in the function (ie a condition has become true and the
    user's program has acted accordingly) have occurred, and the system
    will no longer call the function.

EXAMPLES

SEE ALSO
	CallBocOnCondition()

RESTRICTIONS
    The boc access function (pointed to by boc_fn_ptr) must not take any
    parameters. Once the condition function returns true, the boc access
    function will not be called anymore.
